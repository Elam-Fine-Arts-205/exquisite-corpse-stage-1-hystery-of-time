## Briefs for each stage

### 🔴 Stage 1
Create a sketch that shows an unconventional representation of time. This 'clock' should be constantly changing, but its appearance can repeat in a subsequent cycle. It does not need to follow a 24-hour cycle (you can use any timescale). Give your sketch a unique title and edit the README file accordingly.

### 🟡 Stage 2
Respond to a Stage 1 sketch that you've chosen by using interactivity. You can either add to the chosen sketch or build a new one from scratch (this applies for all subsequent stages too).

### 🟢 Stage 3
Find or construct a dataset that relates to the sketch you've inherited. Incorporate visualisations of the dataset into your response to the Stage 2 sketch.

### 🔵 Stage 4
Adapt a Stage 3 sketch into a text-based game. There should be different pathways through the game. Images (still or moving) can accompany the words (but this is not required).

### 🟣 Stage 5
Reimagine something from a Stage 4 sketch as a living entity or an environment.

*This sketch explores subjective representations of time. The standardised, ordered digits of the 24-hour clock are set against the seemingly 'disorded', fragmented, and uncertain duration of a compulsive act of yawning. Pseudorandom numbers are deployed to produce unpredictable intervals between three stages of a yawn - an act that is repeated incessantly, suggesting the presence of a symptom. The images are taken from the Iconographie photographique de la Salpêtrière, a text which demonstrated the role of photography (a fundamentally time-based medium) in the conceptualisation of hysteria. The staged images of psychical symptoms in the Salpêtrière hospital would inspire Sigmund Freud's theory of hysteria, in which the repetition of symptoms (such as the bodily convulsions characteristic of hysteria) was linked to the 'atemporality' of the unconscious.*
